# BehaviorDection

The project is written in Java, it provides the basic analysis work of developers' debugging behaviors.

## 1. Behavior Detection

In the behavior detection, we are only interedted in the debugging behaviors of developers in their daily work. So we construct the project **BehaviorDetection** to explore the debugging behaviors in the given _MSR 18 Challenge Dataset_. 

## 2. MSR 18 Challenge Dateset

The mining experiments is conducted on top of the [MSR 18 Challenge Dataset](https://2018.msrconf.org/track/msr-2018-Mining-Challenge), which is provided by Sebastian Proksch et al. (see paper [Enriched Event Streams](http://www.st.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/artifacts/msr18-challenge/MSR-Challenge-Proposal.pdf)).

The detail description of dataset is in (www.kave.cc/msr-mining-challenge)[www.kave.cc/msr-mining-challenge], you can also discuss at google forum: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kave-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kave-users).
